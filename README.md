## 🔐 Security Features

- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Input validation on backend
- CORS configuration

## 📝 Environment Variables

### Backend `.env`
```
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quiz-portal
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend `.env`
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check `.env` file has correct MongoDB URI
- Verify port 5001 is not in use

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Verify backend is running on port 5001
- Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` in frontend `.env`
- Look for CORS errors in browser console

**Quizzes not loading:**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check if quizzes exist in MongoDB
- Verify quiz start/end dates are valid
